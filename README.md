# Rust Learning
This repository contains my learning notes of Rust programming language.
It also has sample projects to demonstrate the usage of Rust.

The main reference is [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).

## Table of Contents
WIP. I will add a link to each project when it is ready.

## How to run the samples
1. Install Rust:
    - [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
    - [rustc](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

2. Clone this repository
3. Go to the project -> sample folder:
    - `cd rust`
    - `cd rust/<sample_name>`

4. Run `cargo run` or `cargo build`:
    - `cargo run` # debug mode
    - `cargo run --release` # release mode
    - `cargo build` # build only
    - `cargo build --release` # build only in release mode

After the project is built, you can find the executable in `target/debug` or `target/release` folder.
